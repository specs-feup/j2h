# j2h
Internal DSL that implements Haskell-like syntax using plain Java.

This was done as a way to learn Haskell for the first time, as well as trying to see where we could go with Java 8's lambdas.
 
Folder `test/pt/up/fe/specs/j2h` contains unit tests that use the J2H API, the equivalent Haskell code can be found in the folder `resources/j2h/learning`. The examples where taken from [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters).
